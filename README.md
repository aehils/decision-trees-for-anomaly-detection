# decision-trees-for-anomaly-detection
Anomaly detection in smart factory processes using Decision Tree and k-NN classifiers. This project involves training a decision tree classifier and a k-NN classifier. The data undergoes several stages of cleaning and preparation before being used to train and test the models.
### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x


### Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/aehilsthenomad/decision-trees-for-anomaly-detection.git
   cd decision-trees-for-anomaly-detection

### Data
data/raw/operation_log.csv: The raw dataset.
data/processed/clean_operation_log.csv: The cleaned dataset.
data/processed/prepared_operation_log.csv: The prepared dataset ready for model training.

### Acknowledgements

This project includes code from another repository:

factory-sim - Files client.py, factory.py, and recipe.py were originally retrieved from this repository. Significant changes have been made to client.py and factory.py, while recipe.py remains largely unchanged but is necessary for the functionality of the simulation.

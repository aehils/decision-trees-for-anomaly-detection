# decision-trees-for-anomaly-detection
Anomaly detection in smart factory processes using Decision Tree and k-NN classifiers. This project involves training a decision tree classifier and a k-NN classifier. The data undergoes several stages of cleaning and preparation before being used to train and test the models.
